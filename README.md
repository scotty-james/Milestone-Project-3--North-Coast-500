### Strategy

#### External user’s goal

- Read the reviews of others who have experienced the route in order to gain real life reviews that can help me make a decision. 
- Creating an account should be simple and quick, requiring as little personal information as possible.  -
-  Share my own experience with others by submitting reviews and rating my trip. 
- Access additional information outside the website to explore further and gain more insight (links to external sources, dedicated websites etc)


#### Site owner's goal

- Built a site that provides specific information to a targeted audience. 
- Create a site that allows users to submit reviews in order to share their experience with others. 
- Create a site that allows users to manipulate their review input by being able to update or delete their previous posts. 
- Create a site that is user friendly and provides the targeted user with inspiration and links to further information.

- External links to all information outlines on the home page to allow the user to gain deeper information should they want to. 
- Provide information on places to stay, food and drink, beaches and coastal regions of the route, and scotland’s wildlife likely to be encountered along the route.
