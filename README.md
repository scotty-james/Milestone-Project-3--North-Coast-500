## <p align="center"> UX

### User Stories

> - As a new website user, I want to understand the website purpose easily so that I remain interested in exploring the site further. 
> - s a new website user, I want to understand the reasons why I need to create an account so that I can make a decision on the value of doing so. 
> - As an existing user I want to be able to create and update my own personal reviews so that I have full control on the content I submit. 
> - As an existing user I want to be able to delete any review I have submitted so that I have full control on the content I submit. 
> - As an existing user, I want to be able to log out at any point when I am finished so that I know my account is secure. 

### Strategy

#### External user’s goal

- Read the reviews of others who have experienced the route in order to gain real life reviews that can help me make a decision. 
- Creating an account should be simple and quick, requiring as little personal information as possible.  -
-  Share my own experience with others by submitting reviews and rating my trip. 
- Access additional information outside the website to explore further and gain more insight (links to external sources, dedicated websites etc)


#### Site owner's goal

- Built a site that provides specific information to a targeted audience. 
- Create a site that allows users to submit reviews in order to share their experience with others. 
- Create a site that allows users to manipulate their review input by being able to update or delete their previous posts. 
- Create a site that is user friendly and provides the targeted user with inspiration and links to further information.


### Scope

#### Scope In

- A homepage that provides information about Scotland's north coast 500 road trip route, including the key stopping points along the route. 
- A visual image of the route above the fold on the website to draw the user’s initial attention to the route map and key stops along the way. 
- External links to all information outlines on the home page to allow the user to gain deeper information should they want to. 
- Provide information on places to stay, food and drink, beaches and coastal regions of the route, and scotland’s wildlife likely to be encountered along the route. 
- A review page containing all reviews submitted by other users. 
- Ability for new users to create an account on the site. 
- Ability for existing users to log into their account.
- A review form that allows users to create and submit a review. 
- An edit review form that allows users to update previously posted reviews. 
- A delete review form that allows users to remove previously posted reviews. 
- Ability to log out of the site. 

#### Scope Out

- Customer profile page
- Ability to like or add comments to other users' reviews. 
- Search functionality to allow users to search reviews. 


### Structure

The structure of information on the site will follow a very simple design and navigation flow. As an information based website, the goal is to make the siete as easy as possible for the user to navigate.  
#### Home Page
- Main page with key relevant information on the website's purpose - the North Coast 500 road trip route. A map of the route is displayed above the fold to instantly allow the user to visualize the route as soon as they enter the website. 
- A link directing the user to the dedicated review page is also above the fold to allow customers to instantly navigate to this page if they wish to do so. 
#### Sign Up Page
- Contains the form that allows a new user to create an account. 
#### Sign In Page
- Contains the form that allows existing users to sign into their account.
#### Reviews Page
- A dedicated page containing the reviews posted by users of the site. This page is populated using the data submitted by users filling in a review form and submitting the review to the site.
#### Add Review Form
- An ‘ADD Review’ Tab is placed in the nav bar which allows the user to submit a review directly on the website. 
-- The Add Review Tab displays in the nav bar whether or not the customer is logged in, however, in the event the user is not logged in, when clicked a model will appear prompting the user to either sign in or create an account. If the user is logged in, they are directed straight to the review form. 
#### Edit Review & Delete Form
- Both of these forms are located within the reviews page and display only when the user is logged in and has previously submitted at least one review. 
Sign Out Tab
- This nav bar link allows the user to sign out of their account and will only display on the navbar if a user has signed into their account.
#### Footer 
- A fixed footer that contains additional information and navigational options for both new and existing users of the site. 


### Skeleton

- The website has been designed to allow the user to navigate through the journey effortlessly. 
- The nav bar links are designed to display relevant to whether the user is logged into the site or not. 
- The user will be immediately navigated to the main reviews page upon submitting a review. 
- When attempting to delete a review, the user will be navigated to a dedicated page that will provide additional protection in case the user clicked delete by mistake. 
- The user will flow to the login page after clicking the logout button, enabling them to log back in quickly if this was done in error. 


#### Wireframes

All wireframes were created using [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/).

### Surface

#### Design

The website’s sole purpose is to display information and reviews on Scotland’s north coast 500 road trip. This is an extremely scenic route through the Scottish mountains and around 500 miles of coastline. Therefore, the page is designed for lots of images. The main page has many images of the route to engage with the user as they are most likely on the page to help plan and visualise their dream road trip. 

#### Colour

The color scheme is very simple, white and blue, using the blue from the Scotish Flag as my inspiration for the site.

#### Typography

Typography
In line with websites simplicity I have only used one font throughout - Righteous! 

![Google Fonts](static/images/readme_images/readme-googlefonts.png)

I really liked the simplicity of Open Sans and therfore didn't feel the need from a design perspective to add any additional fonts.
